# DeepDive Analytics

## Rationale
The purpose is for engineering and user experience. 
Analytics provide anonymous eyes into use of the application that can help with 
understanding user intent and how to improve the application. The difficult challenge
is not figuring out what to put into an app, but what can be removed.

## Rest Interfaces
* The obvious cmds are logged. 
* Value may be either 1 or execution time.

## Decompile Challenge
The problem is capturing application failure.  When a stage of decompile is started but 
fails with result other than an exception.

* Stage runs for an hour and fails.
* Stage never finishes
* Stage finishes normally
