# DeepDive-Android
An educational tool for the reverse engineering and security assessment of Android apps

We initially experimented with reverse engineering to explore vulnerabilities of our own apps. We learned how hackers find security gaps in our apps. Looking other apps on our phone, we also learned how seemingly legitimate apps invade our privacy.

## Finally, a workflow you can live with
Android is the server. Access the details of reverse engineering from the convenience of your Mac or PC.
* The source code is at your fingertips using the elFinder "Mac-like" file manager.
* Your code is secure on your hardware, not on an unknown server in the Cloud.
* Additional tools include Keystore, Shell, and Logcat.
* DeepDive maintains the tools, you simply point and click.

## Lucene â€” Ultra-fast search
A decompiled app can have hundreds of thousands of files and millions of lines of code.
That's why DeepDive has Lucene, a near-instant search capability, the search engine behind Amazon, AOL, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

#### Search for hundreds of keywords at a time
Search Sets are collections of Lucene Searches. Search for up to a 100 keywords at a time. The app comes with default Search Sets and you can create your own.
